LSTM speedup, LSTM is way too slow: 14 secs for training on 10 sentences.
I tried setting a few flags and running the theano function profiler
but nothing popped out. The last thing I'll try before giving up on
theano is to switch U[:, xt] -> U.dot(xt), i.e. use one-hots instead of
index-vectors.

Clean up data more and train on clean data
Try with smaller vocabulary



LSTM - done, but see above
Test WildML speed - done, just as slow
Get GPU Support/Test training on GPU - not done, but given up on
Sentence generation function - done
Batch training - done, was 10x slower for some reason
