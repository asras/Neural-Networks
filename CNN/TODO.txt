Experiment with hyperparameters:
	Learning rate
	Network structure
	Optimization algorithm
	??
Try using the architectures on MNIST data 
	- Are the archs bad or is the problem just harder than
		regular MNIST?
Try using the same archs but with Adam
Submit to Kaggle?? Dont even know if competition is still running.




DONE
Train on 40k examples.
Validate on 10k examples.
Try adding possible to choose to run several batches.
	Maybe AWS can handle that better.
